README for covers80 package

This is a set of data and code to support the MIREX cover song 
identification task.

The directory covers32k/ contains 80 songs with two versions of 
each, all encoded as 32 kbps MP3 (mono, 16k sampling, bandwidth 
limited to 7 kHz).  The basis of this set was cover versions 
I found within the uspop2002 set, but then I added a bunch of 
others (including pairing up all the tracks I could on cover song 
albums by Annie Lennox and Tori Amos).

The directory src/ contains the current version of my coversongID
code, which is very close to what I submitted to the MIREX2006 
cover song task.  You can run it on the 32kbps covers80 tracks with 
the script do_cover_expt.m.

Please let me know if you have any problems or comments.
